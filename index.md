## About Me

I am a finance major at the [Lehigh college of business](https://business.lehigh.edu/) with special interests in international relations and computer science. My time at university has been shaped by my desire to make complex financial concepts digestible; as it is my opinion that the public school system lacks adequate curricula for these topics. As an employee: I will use detail oriented analysis to identify inefficient systems and promote optimized solutions.

## FIN 377 Team Final Project

For our final project, team Strong-Side-Left-Side performed a detailed analysis of Boston AirBnB prices. We used machine learning to create models that give suggested, in-sample list prices. A prospective AirBnB host in boston can use this website as a tool to get an idea of how to price their listings.

## Personal Projects

To enhance the speed at which I learned pandas, I made a mortgage payment calculator that displays an amortization table and graph. It can be exported as a .py function for use in other projects.
